An exercise I learned in Udemy that is similar to Jinyang's app of hotdog or not hotdog app.

PS. Jinyang is a reference to the TV Series Silicon Valley

What I Learned

- Use of Visual Recognition using IBM Watson
- Use of ImagePicker to capture photo of a potential hotdo
- Use of social library to allow user to share the hotdog image to Twitter
- Resize the photo captured to enable faster upload of the file for classification wether it is or not a hotdog
